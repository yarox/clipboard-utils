* CLIPBOARD-UTILS 
Perform some useful actions on your clipboard contents. 

The idea is that you select some text, and instantly, you have some action processed on that selection; ie. translation, dictionary, etc.


* IN THIS RELEASE
By now, it only acts as a translator. More features to come.


* HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS
Gnome based desktop, and Python 2.6.5, with:
  gtk,
  glib,
  urllib,
  json.
     
Tested on Ubuntu 10.04 i686.


* INSTALLATION
Access the "clipboard-utils" folder and execute "python   playwords.py", and you'll have translation capabilities from english to spanish.


* GETTING STARTED
Edit the file "playword.py", and change the variables "LANG_FROM" and "LANG_TO" in order to have diferent translations.

  
* CAVEATS
To end the program, you have to kill it directly. 
  
When you select some text in Google Chrome, it doesn't wait untill you release the mouse button; instead, it tries to translate each letter it encounters. 

It just has the translation feature.
